This Exhibit shall automatically renew at the end offue Initial Tenn (and thereafter) for additional pe1iods of twelve (12) months (each a \"Renewal Term\") at Guidewire's then-cunent fees (provided that Guidewire provides notice of any increase in fees to be applicable during the next Renewal Te1m at least ninety (90) days prior to tl1e end of the then-cU1Tent tenn), U11less te1minated by either party by written notice no less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-cmTent tenn. Solely for the purposes of this Exhibit, the Initial Te1m and any Renewal Term(s) are referred to as the \"Exhibit Tenn\".The mmual License Fee for Year 1 is due on tl1e Effective Date of the Agreement. The mmual License Fees for the balance of the Exhibit Tenn are payable on each applicable anniversaty of the Effective Date.Supp01tFees are included in the annual License Fees during the Exhibit Term. The annual License Fees me subject to adjustrnents pursuant to the \"Growth Rates\" Sections of this Exhibit.The License Fees in this Exhibit are based on Licensee's direct written premiums (\"DWP\") in a calendar year of$200 Million. The level of DWP which will be the basis of calculating incremental License Fees (if any are required pursuant to the tenns hereof) is subject to adjustment from time to time as set fo1th in this Exhibit A based on the amount of incremental License Fees paid. Such amount as it may be adjusted from time to time is referred to herein as the \"DWP Baseline.\" Once the annual level of DWP has reached $800,000,000 and Licenseehas paid the appropriate fee associated with that level, then no subsequent incremental License Fees shall be imposed for any reason.If Licensee's DWP increases less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the then-applicable DWP Baseline, then Licensee will maintain the cmTent License Fees and no incremental license fees will be incuned pursuant to any of the provisions of this Exhibit. For the purposes hereof, the term \"Buffer'' means the amount which is 125% of the then-applicable DWP Baseline.Incremental License Fees During the Initial Term.During the InitialTerm, incremental License Fees are only payable basedon DWP growth resulting from Licensee acquiring, purchasing, or merging with any other company or entity or acquisition of assets (\"Non-Organic Growth\"). However, incremental License Fees may be accrued dming tl1e Initial Tenn because of growth not atuibutable to Non-Organic Growth (\"Organic Growth\") andmay become payable immediately following the end of the Initial Term. Specifically, at the beginning of the first Renewal Te1m, if any, or upon the exercise by Licensee of the Perpetual Buyout Option as described in Section 4 hereof, Licensee shall pay, in addition to any other amount then due, the amount of anyaccrued but unpaid incremental License Fees that would have resulted dming the Initial Term as a result of Licensee's Organic Growth. The additional License Fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.Inc1·emental License Fees During any Renewal Term.During any Renewal Term, if Licensee's DWP surpasses the Buffer for any reason (e.g., Non-Organic Growth or Organic Growth), then (i) Licensee will pay anadditional, annual, incremental License Fee at the end of such te1m and any succeeding Renewal Term following Licensee's initial use of the Licensed Software in conjunction with such added DWP, and (ii) for all future calculations of incremental License Fees, the amount of theDWP Baseline shall be adjusted by the amomlt of DWP for which Licensee has paid incremental License Fees. Licensee agrees to report any use of the Software in conjunction with such incremental D\\VP to Guidewi.re within thirty (30) days from initial use. The incremental license fee shall apply to all DWP increases once Licensee exceeds the Buffer. The incremental license fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.Perpetual Buyout Option. At the end of the Initial Tenn or at the end of any Renewal Tenn (provided that Licensee has paid all applicable fees dming the Initial Tenn and any applicable Renewal Tem1), Licensee will have an option to make the license term perpetual by paying the amounts desc1ibed in this Section 4 (the \"Perpetual Buyout Option\"). Licensee may exercise its Perpetual Buyout Option at the end of the Initial Tem1or any Renewal Tenn by paying the following fees:One-time, lump smn License Fee equal to 300% of the.annual fee during the last year of the tenn license (i.e., Year 5 of theInitial Tenn or the last Renewal Tenn) to be paidupon exercise of the Perpetual Buyout Option, and no subsequent annual License Fees shall ever be payable.Supp01t Se1vices not include included in the perpetual License Fee. Licensee may purchase Support Services for the initial, annual Supp01t Fee in an amount equal 50% the annual fee during the last year of the tenn license (i.e., Year 5 of the Initial Tenn or the last Renewal Te1m).If, after Licensee exercises the Perpetual Buyout Option (the \"Perpetual Term\"), Licensee's DWP surpasses the Buffer for any reason (e.g. Non-Organic Growtl1 or Organic Growth), then Licensee will pay a one-time incremental License Fee following Licensee's initial use the Licensed Software in conjunction with such added DWP. Licensee agrees to report any use of the Software in conjunction withsuch incremental DWP to Guidewire within thirty (30) days from initial use. The incremental license fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.If Licensee is obligated to pay an incremental License Fee as set forth above and purchases Support Se1vices, then Licensee shall also pay incremental Supp01t Fees equal to 20% of such incremental License Fees. Licensee shall pay those Supp011Fees contemporaneously with such incremental license fee. Guidewire will prorate the incremental Support Fees for the then-cunent Suppo1t Se1vices annual tenn.Nonvithstanding any other te1m of the Agreement or this Exhibit, if Guidewire consents to the assignment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.b. of the Agreement, then Guidewi.re may condition such consent on the Software license being restricted to use in conjunction with the amount of Licensee's DWP immediately prior to such assignmentCalculations of Incremental License Fees. For any calculation of any incremental license fee required pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2, 3 or 4 hereof, such fees shall be calculated as follows:1st Bandbut less than $300.000,000:DWP Baseline multiplied by $0.001352ndBand> =$300,000,000 < $400,000,000:amount greater of$300,000,000 or multiplied by $0.001113,dBand> =$400,000,000 < $800,000,000:amount greater of $400,000,000 or multiplied by $0.000874th Band> $800,000,000:no additional incremental fee is dueIn making the calculations pursuant to the above table, if the applicable DWP is in a higher numbered band than the band of the then-applicable DWP Baseline, then the incremental license fee v.rill be the sum of the amounts dete1mined with respect to each applicable lower-numbered band and the band of the DWP.EXHIBITBMAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICESSUPPORT SERVICES. Suppmt Services consist of (a) E-Mail Suppmt and Telephone Support provided to designated Licensee technical support contact(s) concerning the installation, use, and resolution of Issues relating to Supported Releases of the Sofuvare, and (b) the provision of any Updates at no additional cost to Licensee. Licensee may designate up to four (4) Licensee technical suppo1t contacts to request Suppmt Services. All Licensee support contacts must be trained in the use of Software. Guidewire provides E-Mail Support and Telephone SuppmtMonday through Friday during the following hours: 9:00 am to 8:00 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time), excluding holidays. In addition, Guidewire provides suppo1t 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for Severity Level 1 issues only.SUPPORT SERVICES REQUESTS. Licensee shall use the methods described in Section l above to engage Guidewire Support Services. Guidewire will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve Issues. Guidewire may use any reasonable resolution method available (e.g. fixes, workarounds, etc.) to resolve an Issue. Guidewire will classify and respond to repmted Issues according to the Severity Levels and response periods set forth in Schedule A to this Exhibit. Guidewire does not guarantee resolution to Issues within the response period, only response to initial calls. Failure to contact a Licensee within the response time period because the Licensee is unavailable (e.g. phone busy, no answer, in a meeting, or out of the office) does not constitute Guidewire's noncompliance with the response cmmnitment.NON-GUIDEWIRE ISSUES. If Guidewire reasonably believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Issue related to the Software, Guidewire will notify Licensee. At that time, Licensee may(1) instruct Guidewire to proceed with Issue determination at Licensee's possible expense as set forth below, or (2) instmct Guidewire that Licensee does not wish the Issue pursued. If Licensee requests that Guidewire proceed with Issue determination at Licensee's possible expense and Guidewire reasonably dete1mines that the issue was not due to an Issue in the Software, Licensee shall pay Guidewire's then-cmrent and standard consulting rates for allwork perforn1ed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable and necessary related expenses incmTed therewith. Licensee shall not be liable for (i) Issue detemlination or repair to the extent problems are due to an Issue in the Sofuvare, (ii) work perfo1med under this paragraph in excess of Licensee's instrnctions, or (iii) work perfonned after Licensee has notified Guidewire that it no longer wishes work on the Issue determination to be continued at its possible expense (such notice shall be deemed given when actually received by Guidewire).","Images":0}
